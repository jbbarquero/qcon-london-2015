# QCon London 2015


On 6/3/2015 I gave a talk at QCon London, this is the demo code and examples from that talk.


## Reactive application design for high volume multi-dimensional temporal data series

"The emerging Reactive Streams specification is well suited to the design of high volume streaming applications that process ordered. We'll examine some of the problems faced, (and solutions developed), during the development of a real world application that uses Spring Integration, Spring Expression Language, Reactor (and the LMAX Disruptor) to process billions of events per day and demonstrate some the ways that the JVM can be (occasionally Unsafely) used to get there."
